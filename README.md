# Hi c:

I'm Aura, also known as Lunar, or Lunarnova. I'm a college student pursuing the field of Anthropology with a passion for teaching. I have recently picked up coding as a hobby however I spend more of my time reading or writing over programming, so don't expect too much from me. 

Most of my work on here relates to **NixOS** be it through [Lunix](https://github.com/Lunarnovaa/lunix), my NixOS configuration, or [Hjem Rum](https://github.com/snugnug/hjem-rum), a module collection for [Hjem](https://github.com/feel-co/hjem). I am currently spending a lot of time working with [SNUG](https://github.com/snugnug), a new Nix related organization seeking to bring innovation and comfort to the area with different projects targetting different sectors of it.

You can contact me through Discord `@lunarscythe`.
